Note that many of these scripts are modified from different sources such as Allen Institute, IBL, cortex-lab, etc. I have tried to give credit whenever possible. 

* postprocessingKs2: scripts for post-processing after spike-sorting and manual curation using Kilsort and Phy
  * utilsClusterQual.py: functions for cluster quality metrics (ISI violations, presence ratio, amplitude cutoff, firing rate threshold)
  * utilsWaveformMetrics.py: functions for calculating waveform metrics (amplitude, peak-to-trough, repolarization slope, spread)
